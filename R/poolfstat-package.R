#' @description Functions for the computation of F-statistics from Pool-Seq data in population genomics studies. The package also includes several utilities to manipulate Pool-Seq data stored in standard format ('vcf' and 'rsync' files as obtained from the popular software 'VarScan' and 'PoPoolation' respectively) and perform conversion to alternative format (as used in the 'BayPass' and 'SelEstim' software).
